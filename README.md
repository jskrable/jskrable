# Hey, I'm Jack üëã

Full stack engineer and architect with 10+ years building scalable systems that actually matter. Currently founding engineer at Ounce, previously led engineering at Beam where we moved ~$500M in social safety net payments.

## üöÄ What I'm Up To

## üíº Where I've Been

**Lead Software Engineer @ Beam** *(June 2021 - Sept 2024)*

- Designed authentication for 150k+ users, then migrated to Google Identity Platform
- Created a ReBAC authorization system using Zanzibar patterns
- Led infrastructure migration from AWS EKS to GCP Cloud Run
- Built fraud prevention service using fuzzy matching that outperformed legacy systems in state audits

**Integration Programmer @ Boston University** *(2017 - 2021)*
